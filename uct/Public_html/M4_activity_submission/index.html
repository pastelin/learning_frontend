        <img
            src="./images/optimised_image1.jpeg"
            alt="Square of a town with a church in the middle"
        />
        <p>
            I chose to optimise this image because it is a large image and it is
            important to ensure that the image is not too large for the web
            page. This image is 7.90MB and I have reduced it to 252KB. This will
            help the page load faster and will also help with SEO. I have also
            reduced the image dimensions to 700x700 pixels. This will help the
            image to load faster and will also help with SEO.
        </p>
        <img

            I chose to optimise this image because it is a large image and it is
            important to ensure that the image is not too large for the web
            page. This image is 3.14MB and I have reduced it to 34.4KB. This
            will help the page load faster and will also help with SEO. I have
            also reduced the image dimensions to 200x500 pixels. This will help
            the image to load faster and will also help with SEO. I chose this
            image because according to my criteria it is the one that best fits
            the required dimensions. That's why I only had to make a brief width
            reduction so that it didn't seem distorted.

        <img
            src="./images/optimised_image3.jpeg"
            alt="A person holding a letter"
        />
        <p>
            I chose to optimise this image because it is a large image and it is
            important to ensure that the image is not too large for the web
            page. This image is 2MB and I have reduced it to 180KB. This will
            help the page load faster and will also help with SEO. I have also
            reduced the image dimensions to 1080x768 pixels. This will help the
            image to load faster and will also help with SEO. I chose this image
            because, being a person holding a letter, it can be interesting for
            users and I chose the dimensions so that it quickly adapts to the
            full width of the screen.

        <h2>Rationale 2</h2>
        <p>
            To optimize the images, I used the Paint tool where I reduced the
            size of the images and the dimensions. For the first image, I
            reduced the size from 7.90MB to 252KB and the dimensions from
            2456x2832 to 700x700, which I chose for having the dimensions
            closest to a square. For the second image, I reduced the size from
            3.14MB to 34.4KB, the dimensions from 3363x4708 to 200x500, and
            cropped the width to prevent the image from being distorted. For the
            third image, I reduced the size from 2MB to 180KB and the dimensions
            from 6000x4000 to 1080x768. These optimizations will help the page
            load faster and will also help with SEO. I chose this image to make
            a greater first impact.
