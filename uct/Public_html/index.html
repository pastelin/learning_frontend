        <h1>THE BASICS OF CODING FOR WEB DESIGN</h1>

        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose of HTML is to define a structure for web documents,
            which consists of a series of tags that define specific content.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The h1 to h6 tags are used to define headings</li>
            <li>The p tags are used to define paragraphs</li>
            <li>The a tags are used to define links</li>
            <li>The img tags are used to define images</li>
            <li>The ul, ol, and li tags are used to define lists</li>
            <li>The table, tr, td, and th tags are used to define tables</li>
            <li>
                The form, input, textarea, select, and button tags are used to
                define forms
            </li>
            <li>
                Additionally, there are semantic tags like header, footer, nav,
                section, article, and aside.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            All these tags help us structure the content of our web page in a
            more organized and accessible way.
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML is strongly related to the front-end because it is the direct
            interaction with the user. On the other hand, all the information
            handled on the front-end can be sent to the back-end for processing.
        </p>

        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose of CSS is to provide a more pleasant visualization to
            the structures defined in HTML. CSS has the following features:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Access to the properties of HTML elements through tags, classes,
                and IDs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Weight of CSS rules, where more specific rules have greater
                weight.
            </li>
            <li>
                The cascade of styles, where rules are applied from top to
                bottom.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use of selectors, where HTML elements can be selected
                specifically.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In summary, CSS allows us to manipulate color, text font, images,
            font size, positioning, and much more, giving life to our websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            CSS is strongly related to the front-end because it is the direct
            visualization that the user has. Unlike HTML, CSS does not have the
            ability to send information to the back-end because it only handles
            presentation.
        </p>

        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
            JS is a programming language, which is interpreted by web browsers.
            Additionally, it is a loosely typed programming language compared to
            other programming languages like Java. JS allows us to manipulate
            the content of web pages dynamically, making them more interactive.
            With JS we can modify HTML and CSS elements, perform validations of
            information provided by the user, among other things.
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript is strongly related to the front-end because it is the
            direct interaction with the user, where validations and
            manipulations of information can be performed. On the other hand,
            all the information handled on the front-end can be sent to the
            back-end for processing.
